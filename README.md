# mayhem-ai

Because this game never dies and deserved to meet Python and AI.

The original game by [Espen Skoglund](http://hol.abime.net/3853) was born in the early 90s on the Commodore Amiga. That was the great time of MC68000 Assembly.

Around 2000 we made a [PC version](https://github.com/devpack/mayhem) of the game in C++.

It was then ported to [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) by [Martin O'Hanlon](https://github.com/martinohanlon/mayhem-pi), even new gfx levels were added.

It was early time this game had its own Python version. [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs) SDL wrapper has been used as backend.

The ultimate goal porting it to Python is to create a friendly AI environment (like [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari)) which could easily be used with deep learning frameworks. AI players in Mayhem are coming !
